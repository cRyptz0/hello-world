 ideas and plans for programming

### About Me
I am a freshman in college majoring in Computer Science.

I've only just started to understand program and am using the time I have to go through courses during this summer. I am currently undertaking CS50P - Introduction to Programming with Python.

During the summer I plan to take at least 3 to 4 courses:
1. [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (MIT)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7?irclickid=wkzUWQ1igzBZUlRQogy4AXFhUkASpk3ZWQ0I1Y0&irgwc=1)
2. [CS50's Intro to Computer Science (Harvard)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?irclickid=wkzUWQ1igzBZUlRQogy4AXFhUkASpk2RWQ0I1Y0&irgwc=1)
3. [Computational Thinking for Problem Solving (Penn)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving?irclickid=xGRW%3AgVzdxyNUclwiC3XPyx7UkASpk1RWQ0I1Y0&irgwc=1)
4. [Mathematics for Computer Science (UoL)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematics-for-computer-science?irclickid=xGRW%3AgVzdxyNUclwiC3XPyx7UkASpkVxWQ0I1Y0&irgwc=1)
